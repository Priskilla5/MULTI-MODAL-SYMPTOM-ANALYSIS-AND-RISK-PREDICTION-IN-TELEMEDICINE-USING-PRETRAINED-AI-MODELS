# Multi-Modal Symptom Analysis and Risk Prediction in Telemedicine using Pretrained AI Models

![Architecture Diagram](https://i.postimg.cc/YqCNr8wB/main-diagram.png)

##  Project Overview

In today’s fast-evolving healthcare landscape, remote diagnosis and patient care have become more critical than ever. This project introduces an AI-powered telemedicine solution capable of **analyzing both visual and textual symptoms** to provide **accurate medical condition predictions, risk severity classification, and appropriate health guidance** — all powered by cutting-edge pretrained models.

This system enables users to upload **images (e.g., wounds, rashes)** and **describe symptoms via text**, and in return, they receive **diagnostic insights**, **severity assessment**, and **remedies or escalation suggestions**, making healthcare more **accessible, faster, and efficient**.

##  Key Features

- 📷 Image analysis using **CLIP**
- 💬 Text-based diagnosis with **BioGPT**
- 🧠 Conflict resolution using **LLaMA**
- ⚠️ Severity classification via **BioClinicalBERT**
- 🩹 Treatment and remedy suggestions via **MediSearch API**
- 🌐 Fully integrated **Flutter frontend** and **Flask backend**

##  System Architecture

The architecture diagram above outlines the complete flow of data and model interactions.

1. **User Input**:
   - Upload a **medical image**
   - Enter a **brief description of symptoms**

2. **CLIP Model (Image Analysis)**:
   - Processes the image and classifies probable medical conditions.

3. **BioGPT (Textual Analysis)**:
   - Analyzes symptoms text to predict conditions.

4. **LLaMA (Decision Resolver)**:
   - Resolves any conflicts between image and text predictions.

5. **BioClinicalBERT (Severity Classifier)**:
   - Assesses severity as Low, Medium, or High.

6. **MediSearch API (Remedy Engine)**:
   - Suggests remedies for Low/Medium severity.
   - Flags High severity for doctor consultation.

##  Use Case Scenarios

- Skin rash detection and remedy advice
- Burn or wound image analysis with severity estimate
- Early identification of visible skin infections
- Symptom-based risk prediction (e.g., fever + sore throat)
